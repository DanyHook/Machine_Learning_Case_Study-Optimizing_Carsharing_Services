# ðŸš— Machine Learning Case Study: Optimizing Carsharing Services

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

In this notebook, we walk through a real-world machine learning pipeline â€” from problem definition to model evaluation â€” using a case study on **carsharing service optimization**.

As a data analyst or aspiring ML engineer, understanding the end-to-end flow of building predictive models is key. This project focuses on practicing and consolidating core skills around:

### ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to **select the best model** based on relevant evaluation metrics.
- How to **prepare, preprocess, and train data** effectively.
- How to **evaluate model performance** and tie it back to business goals.
- How to **draw actionable insights** from predictions to optimize operations.

Throughout this project, you'll simulate what a real analyst does: check assumptions, compare model types, measure accuracy, and suggest improvements.

This case study is more than a technical exercise â€” it's a decision-making process. You're not just building a model; you're proposing a solution that improves a company's **carsharing strategy**.

Letâ€™s dive into the pipeline and make data work for better mobility solutions!
